     <h1>Balance</h1>
     <p> From the textbook White Space is Not Your Enemy: in design, we think of balance in terms of visual weight. You want your designs and layouts to be visually balanced, unless your communication purpose is to unsettle people by making them feel unbalanced and tense or anxious. There are three kinds of visual balance: radial, symmetrical and asymmetrical.</p>
       <p>Balance is the element of design that allows viewers to see the design as a sensible and pleasing design. Essentially to create balance in a design there should be an arrangement of objects to create a feeling of equal weight, often created through use of symmetry.</p>
    
    <figure>
     <img src="balance.JPG" class="responsive" alt="sunflower picture frames"/>
     <figcaption>These sunflower picture frames create equal weight since the mirror each other so create a balanced image.
     </figcaption>
        
           <p></p>
        <p>Balance is important in all areas of life, but especially in design. When people see my designs I want them to have pleasant feelings towards them. To account for that I will make sure that my designs are always balanced.
