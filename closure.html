     <h1>Closure</h1>
     <p> From the textbook White Space is Not Your Enemy:we mentally fill in the gaps in order to complete a perceived shape. The idea of designing with only a part but having your viewer perceive the whole opens up interesting compositional opportunities, including the interplay of positive and negative space. How cool is that?</p>
<p> Humans have incredible intelligent brains that are able to fill gaps and make visual predictions when we look at designs. Essentially the mind has the inclination to connect fragmenting into to produce a completed form. So when creating a design its ok to leave an object  incomplete or a space that is not completely enclosed. If enough of the shape is indicated, people percieve the whole by filling in the missing information. </p>

        <h2>Smart Phone Image</h2>
     <img src="closure.JPG" class="responsive" alt="Fancy Feast cat food logo with a heart that does not fully close."/>
     <figcaption>This logo has a heart that comes of the letter F. It is left open but the viewer is able to fill in the gap and see that it is a heart.

        <h2> DSLR Image</h2>
        <img src="new-dslr-images/closure-dslr.jpg" class="responsive" alt="A disabled parking sign where all the lines in the wheel do not connect to the rest of the design."/>
     <figcaption>In this design the wheel does not fully connect to the wheel chair but the viewer is able to fill in the gap to see that the design is of a person in a wheel chair.
           <p></p>

        <p>When I am making designs I will need to remember that it's ok to include an image that has missing parts, because your brain will fill in the blanks and make a complete image so you can still recognize the pattern.</p>
