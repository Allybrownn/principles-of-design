     <h1>Unity</h1>
     <p> From the textbook White Space is Not Your Enemy: unity means that all the parts of the design work together, and everything looks like it belongs together. A layout is visually unified if its different parts have visual links or relationships to one another. A good design has some consistency in terms of the pattern of type columns, or rhythm of typography, or style of visuals, etc. Unity refers to oneness, that the result is one cohesive design or visual message.p.55</p>
       <p>Unity is the element of a design that brings everything together. Essentially elements in a design combine to make a balanced, harmonious complete whole finished product. The design feels right and everything works together. If your design isn't unified, then it's disjointed. The ultimate goal in design is to communicate a message so if you don't have strong unity in your design then the communication is hindered.</p>

       <p>A proximity is basically just how close items are to each other and how we group those items visually. When making my designs I will make sure I am thinking through all of  the different elements to make sure they have adequate proximity.</p>
