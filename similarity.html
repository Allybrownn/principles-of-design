     <h1>Similarity</h1>
     <p> From the textbook White Space is Not Your Enemy: our minds group things with similar properties, such as color or shape. “ Like goes with like.” In this example, we group squares with squares and circles with circles. In layout, we can use similarity to create order and organization through unity.</p>
       <p> Similarity occurs when objects look similar to one another. People often perceive them as a group or pattern.As mentioned in the unity section of this website unity is an essential part of design that allows the design to come together seamlessly. Similarity is one of the significant contributers to unity in a design.  </p>

     <img src="similarity.jpg" class="responsive" alt="Two women working out with small hand weights while in a lunge."/>
     <figcaption>The two women in this design look extremely similar. They are in the same position, wearing the same type of outfit, and using the same type of weight. This creates a sense of organization in the design.
     </figcaption>
           <p></p>
        <p>I would say that similarity and union have some things that are the same. When creating designs I want to make sure that all the elements in the design are similar enough to work together while still factoring in some contrast in some areas.</p>
