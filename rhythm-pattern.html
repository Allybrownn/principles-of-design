     <h1>Rhythm and Pattern</h1>
     <p> From the textbook White Space is Not Your Enemy: a rhythm is a pattern, whether regular or irregular, also may create a sort of movement we could call rhythm. Think of music, foot tapping, finger snapping, clapping and dancing. In graphic design, rhythmic movement has to with repeating items strategically kind of like a back beat.</p>
       <p>Rhythm and Pattern are elements of design in which some elements recur regularly. Every good song has a good beat that keeps going throughout the whole song. Without that steady beat the song would fall apart and it would be a mess. The same is true when putting together a design. Every good design should have a steady rhythm to it that holds the whole design together. </p>

     <figcaption>This design is an advertisment for hefty plastic bags. The six individual colored blocks are filled with colors that visually go together creating an element of regularity.  </figcaption>
        
           <p></p>
        <p>Without a good rhythm then a design will not make sense. I will make sure that I am intentional about planning out a rhythm before I begin my designs so that as I go through and add other design elements there will still be a steady rhythm as a base.</p>
