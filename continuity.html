     <h1>Continuity</h1>
     <p>  From the textbook White Space is Not Your Enemy:our minds will continue a pattern beyond its ending points. Further, our eyes will follow the direction of a line. Our minds see a single lines or continuation of lines. Applying this concept can add a sense of direction and movement to your layout. Ergo, flow.</p>
       <p> The element of continuity allows elements of a design to appear to be extended for better flow. The eye is drawn along a path, line or curve, preferring to see a single continuous figure than separate lines. This can be used to point towards another element in the composition, and is seen where a line is cut through one object, often in a curve, aligning perfectly with a secondary element</p>

     <img src="continuity.JPG" class="responsive" alt="Kroger grocery store logo with a line appearing to connect from the K to the G."/>
     <figcaption>In this logo our eyes follow the direction of the line which bring together the K and the G. This makes the logo appear to have better flow.
     </figcaption>
           <p></p>
        <p>When putting together my designs I will make sure that I am thinking about continuity. I will make sure that I remember that elements arranged on a line or curve are perceived to be more related than elements not on the line or curve. For that reason when I want things to look related I will put them on a line or a curve.</p>
