     <h1>Movement</h1>
     <p> From the textbook White Space is Not Your Enemy: the principle of movement goes back to the idea that good design controls the eyeâ€™s flow through the composition. The flow of lines can move the eye across the page or screen. Lines, then, can create movement, and different kinds of linear movement tend to communicate different kinds of symbolic messages. Horizontal lines communicate movement flowing left to right or right to left. Vertical lines tend to communicate stability, such as trees and tall buildings. Vertical lines also may communicate inspirational upward movement, such as mountain peaks, or downward movement, such as a waterfall. Diagonal lines communicate exciting dynamic movement. Two converging diagonal lines communicate distance, such as a road disappearing into a vanishing point in the distance. Additionally, curving lines also communicate, for example, distance or meandering movement.p. 53</p>
       <p>Movement allows a design to appear to flow seamlessly. It can be the suggestion of motion in a design as you move from object to object by way of placement and position. Lines play an important role of the movement of a design. The placement, curvature, and direction of lines can enhance a design if they are adequately placed.</p>

        <P>In real life when things move it is easy to see. To communicate movement on a 2D design it can be difficult. I will make sure that I use adequate lines and functions that will show movement. Movement will make my designs come to life.</P>
