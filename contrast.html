     <h1>Contrast</h1>
     <p> From the textbook White Space is Not Your Enemy: contrast, as a principle, offers a great deal of flexibility. There are limitless ways to achieve it. Start with the elements of design. You can employ contrast between filled and empty space. You can employ contrasting sorts of lines or shapes. You may juxtapose contrasting sizes of objects. Introducing a pattern in proximity to no pattern results in contrast. Ditto for texture. Or you may contrast two different kinds of patterns or two different kinds of textures. Color and value also offer powerful contrast tools. Using both dark and light values or colors results in contrast.</p>
    
    <p>Contrast is an important element of design that can not be forgotten. Contrast simply means difference. So you should make elements that are not the same clearly different, not just slightly different. Contrast is one of the most powerful design concepts of them all because really any design element can be contrasted with another. The following are just some of the ways you can achieve contrast:
        <ul>
         <li>The manipulation of space</li>
        <li>Color choices</li>
        <li>Text selection</li>
        <li>Positioning of elements </li>
       
     </ul>

    <p>                                                                                           </p>
       <p>Being a visual media student I need to make sure that when I am putting together my designs, that I am creating contrast. It is easy to just slip into the mindset that a design should be all the same in terms of color, shapes, objects and lines. Its even possible to think that introducing contrast to a design can seem to be chaotic, but instead it adds variety to a design.</p>
